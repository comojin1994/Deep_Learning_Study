    # The modulator, defined as (1 - P_t)^r, is a critical part in focal loss
    # computation. For r > 0, it puts more weights on hard examples, and less
    # weights on easier ones. However if it is directly computed as (1 - P_t)^r,
    # its back-propagation is not stable when r < 1. The implementation here
    # resolves the issue.
    #
    # For positive samples (labels being 1),
    #    (1 - p_t)^r
    #  = (1 - sigmoid(x))^r
    #  = (1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-x))))^r
    #  = (exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))^r
    #  = exp(log((exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))^r))
    #  = exp(r * log(exp(-x)) - r * log(1 + exp(-x)))
    #  = exp(- r * x - r * log(1 + exp(-x)))

    #  = exp(-r * log(1 + exp(-x)))

    # Therefore one unified form for positive (z = 1) and negative (z = 0)
